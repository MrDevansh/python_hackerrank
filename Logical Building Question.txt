1. Program to display removing vowels from a given string: 
Give input as a String and it should remove vowels from the sentence.
 
Example 1: if input string is a sirish, then method should return srsh. 
Example 2: if input string is a hello how you, then method are should return hll hw r y.
Example 3: if input string is a null, then method should return null.


2. Given two sorted arrays, find their common elements between them. 
Example 1: if input : arr1[] ={1,3,4,7} and arr2[]={2,3,5,7}  then method should return {3,7}. 
Example 2: if input : arr1[] ={2,4,6,8,10} and arr2[]={2,6,10}  then method should return {2,6,10}
Example 3: if input : arr1[] ={1,3,4,7} and arr2[]={8,9,10,11}  then method should return null.

3. Printing frequency of each character just before its consecutive occurrences. 

Given a string in such a way that every character occurs in a repeated manner. Your task is to print the string by inserting the frequency of each unique character before it also eliminating all repeated characters. And also have to validate that input string only contains lowercase or uppercase alphabets or numbers 0-9 only.


Example 1: if input : GeeEEKKKSS  then method should return 1G2e2E3K2S. 
Example 2: if input : ccccc0ddFFF  then method should return 5c102d3F
Example 3: if input : AACC**FF then method should return “Invalid String”.


4.  Find the longest palindrome in the given string: 

Longest Palindromic Substring is a computer science problem, where you have to find the longest contiguous substring, which should also be a palindrome. For example, the longest palindromic substring for a string "banana" would be "anana", where the substring is a palindrome, and also the longest of all palindromes in the string.
Example 1: if input string is a babad, then method should return bab. 
Example 2: if input string is abaradar121 then method should return radar.
Example 3: if input string is empty, then method should return “length of the string must be having greater than one”.






String based problems:

1. Program to count the total number of punctuation characters exists in a string
Input: String s= "Good Morning! Mr. Baswaraj Yedrami. Had your breakfast?"
output: Total number of punctuation characters exists in string: 4

2. Program to determine whether two strings are the anagram.(Two Strings are called the anagram if they contain the same characters. However, the order or sequence of the characters can be different.)
Input : String str1="Grab"	String str2="Brag"
output:Both the strings are anagram.

3. Program to replace the spaces of a string with a specefic character
Input: String str="Once is a blue moon";
             char ch='*'
output:
	String after replacing spaces with given character: Once*in*a*blue*moon
4. Program to Find the Largest and Smallest Word in a String
Input: "Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny"
Output:
Smallest word: an
Largest word: extraordinary
5. Text wraping (if a line has so many character make a program to wrap the number of character to 80 in a line and move the remaining to next line)
